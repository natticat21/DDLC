 <h2>Meet the Characters!</h2>
     
<br> Sayori, who is the first to be introduced, is seen as the MC's childhood best friend and neighbor. She is a kind character who truly wishes the best for MC. 
She, like the other characters, is a part of the Doki Doki Literature Club and wishes you to join to become socially ready for college. </br>

<head> The following three are characters the MC meets for the first time during the Club’s meeting. Not much is known about these girls just yet, but so far this is what we know:</head>

<head> Yuri, a timid girl who is self-conscious and apologetic, but is passionate about literature and quick to argue with Natsuki about writing. She likes tea, poems, and collecting decorative knives.</head>
    
<head> Natsuki, a headstrong girl who wishes to be taken seriously. It takes a while for her to get comfortable around new people. Like when MC is introduced into the club, she becomes upset and even complains about how we ruined the atmosphere.
   Natsuki enjoys anime and baking and cute things.</head>

<head> Monika, the club’s president. She is kind, sporty, and popular. She founded the club to create a safe space for those wanting to showcase their passion 
     for literature. Monika likes playing the piano, shopping and bookstores. </head>

</audio></br>
  <br>To me, this sound suggests a kind of "inviting adventurous" theme 
<br>Having heard the sounds, now listen and look to how the visual works with the audio:</br>

  <br>The black and white color scheme and the strange, other-worldly appearance of this odd forest
  in which the boy is sleeping suggest a dystopic environment, a dreamscape, or some sort of
  world of the dead (note 2).</br>
<br>In case you think that finds others like him will provide a sense of community, think again:</br>
<br><img src="limbo.others.two.png"> (note 3)</br>
  <br>These are murderous kids and if the boy fears them, he has good reason, as you as user are about to find
  out.</br>
