 <h2>Meet the Characters!</h2>

<br> Sayori, who is the first to be introduced, is seen as the MC's childhood best friend and neighbor. She is a kind character who truly wishes the best for MC. 
She, like the other characters, is a part of the Doki Doki Literature Club and wishes you to join to become socially ready for college. </br>

 <br> <b> The following three are characters the MC meets for the first time during the Club’s meeting. Not much is known about these girls just yet, but so far this is what we know:</b> </br>

<br> <head> Yuri, a timid girl who is self-conscious and apologetic, but is passionate about literature and quick to argue with Natsuki about writing. She likes tea, poems, and collecting decorative knives.</head> </br>
