 <h2>Meet the Characters!</h2>

     <img src="1.png">
     
<br> Sayori, who is the first to be introduced, is seen as the MC's childhood best friend and neighbor. She is a kind character who truly wishes the best for MC. 
She, like the other characters, is a part of the Doki Doki Literature Club and wishes you to join to become socially ready for college. </br>

 <br> <b> The following three are characters the MC meets for the first time during the Club’s meeting. Not much is known about these girls just yet, but so far this is what we know:</b> </br>
    <img src="2.png">
<br> <head> Yuri, a timid girl who is self-conscious and apologetic, but is passionate about literature and quick to argue with Natsuki about writing. She likes tea, poems, and collecting decorative knives.</head> </br>
        <img src="4.png">
<br> <head> Natsuki, a headstrong girl who wishes to be taken seriously. It takes a while for her to get comfortable around new people. Like when MC is introduced into the club, she becomes upset and even complains about how we ruined the atmosphere.
   Natsuki enjoys anime and baking and cute things.</head>  </br>
    <img src="3.png">
<br> <head> Monika, the club’s president. She is kind, sporty, and popular. She founded the club to create a safe space for those wanting to showcase their passion 
     for literature. Monika likes playing the piano, shopping and bookstores. </head> </br>

       <h2>A morbid twist on the average dating simulator game</h2> 
   <head> Before we start, take a listen to DDLC's lovely opening to the game! </head> 
      <br><audio controls>
  <source src="ddlc intro.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> </audio></br>
        <br> With an upbeat sound, it suggests a kind of "inviting adventurous" theme! </br> 
     <br> <head> It truly does start that way! We begin with the protagonist being pushed into joining a club, specifically the Literature Club, which Sayori is a member of. 
You decide to give it a try and become a member, where you share poetry and learn more about the others in the club. You soon become closer to a member, perhaps even closer than just friends? 
Later in the game, Sayori finally opens up to you about her ongoing depression and even confesses to you. However the MC responds to her confession, she ends up going home.
       When MC realizes she didn't come to school the following day, the MC discovers her hanged body. In disgust and horror, the MC panics as they watch their best friend’s lifeless body in front of them. </head> </br> 

 <br> <head> The game quickly ends and glitches you back to the main menu.</head> </br>
